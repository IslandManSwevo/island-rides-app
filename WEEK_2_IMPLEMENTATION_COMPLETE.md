    // ... 10+ business-specific features
  },
  userTier: {
    isBasicUser: userRole === 'customer',
    isBusinessUser: hasRole(['host', 'owner']),
    isPowerUser: hasRole(['owner', 'admin']),
    isSystemAdmin: userRole === 'admin'
  }
});
```

## 🔗 Integration & Architecture

### Unified Hook: `useIslandRides`
Created a master hook that brings together all Week 1 and Week 2 capabilities:

```typescript
const {
  // Core contexts
  island,           // Island context and utilities
  services,         // Week 1 ServiceRegistry
  roleFeatures,     // Role-based capabilities
  permissions,      // User permissions
  
  // Business operations
  vehicles,         // Island-aware vehicle operations
  bookings,         // Role-aware booking operations
  
  // Utilities
  islandUtils,      // Island-specific utilities
  monitoring,       // Performance tracking
  
  // Quick actions
  quickActions: {
    searchVehiclesOnCurrentIsland,
    getMyRoleBasedDashboardData,
    switchIslandAndRefresh,
  }
} = useIslandRides();
```

### Feature Flag Updates
Enhanced feature flags for Week 2:
```typescript
// Enabled for Week 2
ISLAND_AWARE_SEARCH: true,
ISLAND_CONTEXT_PROVIDER: true,

// Maintained from Week 1
API_SERVICE_CONSOLIDATION: true,
PERFORMANCE_MONITORING: true,
```

### Enhanced Domain Services
Updated `VehicleService` with island-aware methods:
- `searchVehiclesForIsland()`
- `getVehiclesByIsland()`
- `getPopularVehiclesForIsland()`
- `getNearbyVehicles()`
