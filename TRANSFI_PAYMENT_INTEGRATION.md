# Transfi Payment Integration

## ✅ Integration Status: COMPLETE

The KeyLo app has been successfully migrated from Stripe to Transfi payment processing.

## 🔧 What Was Changed

### 1. Dependencies
- ❌ Removed: `@stripe/stripe-react-native` dependency
- ✅ Using: Transfi API via backend service

### 2. Frontend Changes
- **CheckoutScreen.tsx**: Updated payment button text and removed Stripe branding
- **PaymentScreen.tsx**: Already supported multiple payment methods via backend API
- **package.json**: Removed Stripe React Native dependency

### 3. Backend Integration
- **TransfiService**: Fully implemented service for Transfi API integration
- **Payment Endpoints**: 
  - `/api/payments/methods` - Returns available payment methods
  - `/api/payments/create-intent` - Creates Transfi payment intent
  - `/api/payments/webhook` - Handles Transfi webhook notifications

## 💳 Supported Payment Methods

Via Transfi, the app now supports:
1. **Credit/Debit Cards** - Instant processing
2. **Bank Transfers** - 1-2 business days
3. **Cryptocurrency** - USDC, USDT, BTC, ETH (10-30 minutes)

## 🔑 Environment Setup

The following environment variables need to be configured in `backend/.env`:

```env
TRANSFI_API_URL=https://api.transfi.com/v1
TRANSFI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
TRANSFI_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
TRANSFI_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here
```

## 🚀 Payment Flow

1. User completes booking details in `CheckoutScreen`
2. Booking is created in database
3. User is redirected to `PaymentScreen`
4. PaymentScreen fetches available methods from `/api/payments/methods`
5. User selects payment method
6. Frontend calls `/api/payments/create-intent` with booking ID
7. Backend creates Transfi payment intent
8. User is redirected to Transfi payment page
9. After payment, Transfi sends webhook to `/api/payments/webhook`
10. Backend updates booking status to confirmed
11. User is redirected to booking confirmation

## 🧪 Testing

- Backend server runs on port 3003
- Database schema is created with `node create-sqlite-schema.js`
- Test user can be created with `node create-test-user.js`
- Payment endpoints require authentication

## ✅ Migration Complete

✅ Stripe dependencies removed
✅ Transfi integration implemented  
✅ Payment flow updated
✅ Multiple payment methods supported
✅ Webhook handling configured
✅ Database schema supports payment tracking

The app is now ready for production with Transfi as the payment processor!
