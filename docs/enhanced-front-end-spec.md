- **Profile**: International visitors to the Bahamas seeking reliable transportation
- **Key Needs**: Quick vehicle discovery, transparent pricing, trust signals, island navigation guidance
- **Conversion Barriers**: Unfamiliarity with islands, payment method preferences, trust concerns
- **Optimization Focus**: Streamlined island selection, clear pricing, prominent trust indicators

**Local Resident (Secondary - 20% of bookings)**
- **Profile**: Bahamian residents needing occasional vehicle access
- **Key Needs**: Cost-effective options, familiar locations, flexible booking terms
- **Conversion Barriers**: Price sensitivity, local competition awareness
- **Optimization Focus**: Value proposition clarity, local payment methods, competitive pricing visibility

**Business Traveler (Tertiary - 10% of bookings)**
- **Profile**: Professional visitors requiring reliable, efficient transportation
- **Key Needs**: Premium vehicles, instant booking, expense reporting features
- **Conversion Barriers**: Limited premium options, booking complexity

### Design Principles (Enhanced for Conversion)

1. **Island-First Intelligence** - Embrace Bahamian geography while providing clear context and logistics
2. **Conversion Through Clarity** - Prioritize clear information hierarchy that drives booking decisions
3. **Trust Through Transparency** - Build confidence with prominent verification, reviews, and pricing clarity
4. **Mobile-First Optimization** - Prioritize touch-friendly conversion flows with minimal typing
