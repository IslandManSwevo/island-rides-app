# Project Brief: KeyLo

## Executive Summary

KeyLo is a peer-to-peer vehicle rental marketplace specifically designed for the Bahamas, connecting vehicle owners with travelers seeking convenient, local transportation. The platform addresses the critical gap in accessible vehicle rental services across the Bahamian islands by providing a trusted, mobile-first solution that empowers locals to monetize their vehicles while offering visitors seamless access to transportation.

## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points
