# Project Brief: KeyLo

## Executive Summary

KeyLo is a peer-to-peer vehicle rental marketplace specifically designed for the Bahamas, connecting vehicle owners with travelers seeking convenient, local transportation. The platform addresses the critical gap in accessible vehicle rental services across the Bahamian islands by providing a trusted, mobile-first solution that empowers locals to monetize their vehicles while offering visitors seamless access to transportation.

## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points
- **Limited Rental Options**: Traditional car rental companies have minimal presence across the Bahamian islands, particularly on smaller islands
- **High Costs**: Existing rental services charge premium rates due to limited competition and logistics challenges
- **Poor Accessibility**: Tourists and locals struggle to find reliable transportation, especially for inter-island travel
- **Trust Issues**: Peer-to-peer rentals lack verification systems, creating safety and reliability concerns
- **Fragmented Market**: No unified platform exists to connect vehicle owners with renters across the archipelago

### Impact and Urgency
- Tourism represents 50%+ of Bahamas GDP, yet transportation remains a major friction point
- Vehicle owners have untapped income potential from idle assets
- Current solutions fail to serve the unique geography and culture of the Bahamas
