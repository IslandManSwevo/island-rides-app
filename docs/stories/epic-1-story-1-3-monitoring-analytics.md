## User Story

As a **KeyLo product and development team**,  
I want **real-time navigation performance monitoring and analytics**,  
So that **we can detect navigation issues immediately, measure the impact of navigation changes, and ensure optimal user experience across all navigation flows**.

## Story Context

### Existing System Integration

**Integrates with:** 
- Current analytics service integration (likely Firebase Analytics or similar)
- Existing logging service (`src/services/loggingService.ts`)
- Performance monitoring setup in React Native app
- Navigation components in `src/navigation/` directory
- Redux store for navigation state tracking

**Technology:** 
- React Native performance monitoring (Flipper, React DevTools)
- Firebase Analytics or existing analytics service
- Custom logging and monitoring infrastructure
- React Navigation performance utilities
- Real-time alerting system (to be implemented)

**Follows Pattern:** 
- Existing analytics integration patterns
- Current logging service patterns in `src/services/loggingService.ts`
- Performance monitoring patterns used in app
- Error tracking and reporting patterns

**Touch Points:**
- All navigation components and transitions
- User flow completion tracking
- Performance measurement points
- Error boundary integration
- Analytics service integration
- Alerting and notification systems

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **Real-Time Navigation Performance Tracking**

   - Monitor memory usage during navigation operations

2. **User Flow Completion Analytics**
   - Track completion rates for Customer browse-to-booking flow
   - Monitor Host vehicle listing and management flows
   - Measure Owner dashboard and analytics access patterns
   - Identify drop-off points in navigation flows

3. **Error Detection and Alerting**
   - Real-time detection of navigation errors and failures
   - Monitoring for navigation state corruption
   - Deep linking failure detection and reporting
   - Performance degradation alerting with thresholds

### Integration Requirements

4. **Analytics Service Integration**
   - Integrate with existing analytics service without disruption
   - Preserve current analytics tracking and reporting
   - Add navigation-specific metrics to existing dashboards
   - Maintain data privacy and user consent compliance

5. **Logging Service Enhancement**
   - Extend existing logging service for navigation events
   - Structured logging for navigation performance data
   - Error logging with navigation context and stack traces
   - Log aggregation and analysis capabilities

6. **Real-Time Dashboard Integration**
   - Navigation health dashboard with key metrics
   - Real-time performance monitoring display
   - Historical trend analysis for navigation performance
   - Alerting integration with existing notification systems

### Quality Requirements

7. **Monitoring Overhead Minimization**
   - Performance monitoring overhead < 1% of navigation performance
   - Efficient data collection and transmission
   - Batched analytics data submission
   - Minimal impact on user experience

8. **Comprehensive Coverage**
   - Monitor all navigation routes and transitions
   - Track both successful and failed navigation attempts
   - Monitor navigation performance across different device types
   - Cross-platform monitoring for iOS and Android

9. **Alerting and Response**
   - Configurable alerting thresholds for performance degradation
   - Escalation procedures for critical navigation failures
   - Integration with existing incident response procedures
   - Automated recovery procedures where possible

## Technical Notes

### Integration Approach
```typescript
// Navigation Performance Monitoring
interface NavigationMetrics {
  transitionTime: number;
  screenLoadTime: number;
  memoryUsage: number;
  errorCount: number;
  userFlowCompletion: boolean;
}

// Real-time Monitoring Service
class NavigationMonitoringService {
  trackNavigation(route: string, metrics: NavigationMetrics): void;
  trackUserFlow(flowId: string, step: string, success: boolean): void;
  reportError(error: NavigationError, context: NavigationContext): void;
  checkPerformanceThresholds(metrics: NavigationMetrics): AlertLevel;
}
```

### Existing Pattern Reference
- Follow analytics integration patterns from existing service
- Use logging patterns from `src/services/loggingService.ts`
- Implement monitoring utilities similar to existing performance tracking
- Follow error reporting patterns established in current error handling

### Key Constraints
- Monitoring overhead must be under 1% of navigation performance
- Data collection must comply with existing privacy policies
- Integration must not disrupt existing analytics or logging
- Alerting must integrate with existing notification systems
- Real-time monitoring must not affect user experience

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1.3.1: Performance Monitoring Infrastructure
- Implement navigation performance measurement utilities
- Create real-time data collection and transmission
- Set up performance threshold monitoring
- Integrate with existing analytics service

### Task 1.3.2: User Flow Analytics
- Implement user flow completion tracking
- Create navigation funnel analysis
- Set up drop-off point identification
- Integrate flow analytics with existing dashboards

### Task 1.3.3: Error Detection and Alerting
- Implement navigation error detection and reporting
- Create real-time alerting system for navigation issues
- Set up escalation procedures for critical failures
- Integrate with existing incident response systems

### Task 1.3.4: Monitoring Dashboard
- Create navigation health dashboard
- Implement real-time performance monitoring display
- Set up historical trend analysis
- Configure alerting and notification integration

## Definition of Done

## Risk and Compatibility Assessment

### Primary Risk
Monitoring implementation could introduce performance overhead or affect user experience

### Mitigation
- Implement efficient, batched data collection
- Use background processing for analytics data transmission
- Comprehensive performance testing of monitoring overhead
- Gradual rollout with performance impact measurement

### Rollback Plan
- Monitoring can be disabled via feature flags without affecting navigation
- Analytics integration can be reverted to previous configuration
- Alerting can be disabled without affecting application functionality
- Dashboard monitoring is independent of core navigation functionality

### Compatibility Verification
- âœ… **No breaking changes** to existing analytics or logging
- âœ… **Performance impact** measured and kept under 1%
- âœ… **Privacy compliance** maintained with existing policies
- âœ… **Integration compatibility** with existing monitoring systems

## Success Metrics

**Technical Metrics:**
- Monitoring overhead: < 1% impact on navigation performance
- Data collection accuracy: > 99% successful metric collection
- Alerting response time: < 2 minutes for critical navigation failures
- Dashboard update frequency: Real-time updates with < 30 second latency

**Business Metrics:**
