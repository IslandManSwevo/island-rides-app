# Story 1.1: Foundational Verification

## Status

**Current Status:** Completed

## Story

**As a** platform administrator,  
**I want** to implement the backend logic and UI for user and vehicle document uploads,  
**so that** we can establish a secure and compliant foundation for all host-related features.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The database schema is updated with new migration files to support identity fields in the users table and legalDocs fields in the vehicles table.
2. The backend provides secure endpoints for uploading Driver's License, NIB Card, Vehicle Title, and Insurance documents.
3. The frontend includes a new "Verification" section in the user profile where users can upload their required documents.
4. The frontend includes a "Manage Documents" section in the vehicle management flow where hosts can upload titles and insurance for each vehicle.
5. The listingStatus of a vehicle cannot be set to "Active" until all required documents have been uploaded and an admin has approved them.

  - [x] Add clear messaging about verification requirements
  - [x] Update vehicle status indicators in UI

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Database Integration:** 
- Use existing SQLite schema with migration files in `backend/migrations/`
- Follow existing patterns in `backend/db.js` for database operations
- New tables/fields: `users.identity_verified`, `users.documents_uploaded`, `vehicles.legal_docs`, `vehicles.verification_status`

**File Upload Strategy:**
- Utilize existing upload infrastructure in `backend/uploads/` directory
- Follow security patterns established in current codebase
- Implement proper file validation and sanitization
- Use multer middleware for file handling (already in use)

**Frontend Integration:**
- Follow existing screen structure in `IslandRidesApp/src/screens/`
- Use established navigation patterns in `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`
- Leverage existing UI components from `src/components/`
- Maintain consistency with current styling in `src/styles/`

**Authentication & Security:**
- Integrate with existing Firebase Authentication system
- Use established middleware patterns for protected routes
- Follow existing user session management
- Implement proper authorization checks for document access

**API Integration:**
- Extend existing `src/services/apiService.ts` with new endpoints
- Follow established error handling patterns
- Use existing request/response formatting
- Maintain compatibility with current API structure

### Key Technical Considerations

**File Storage:**
- Documents contain sensitive personal information - implement proper encryption
- Consider file size limits and compression for mobile uploads
- Implement secure file naming to prevent conflicts and exposure
- Plan for future cloud storage migration (Firebase Storage)

**Verification Workflow:**
- Design admin approval interface (future story consideration)
- Implement status tracking throughout verification process
- Plan for automated verification features (future enhancement)
- Consider notification system for status updates

**Mobile UX:**
- Optimize camera integration for document capture
- Implement image quality validation
- Provide clear guidance for document photo requirements
- Handle offline scenarios and upload queuing

### Testing

**Testing Standards:**
- **Test File Location:** `backend/__tests__/` for backend tests, component tests alongside components
- **Test Standards:** Follow existing Jest patterns in codebase
- **Testing Frameworks:** Jest for backend, React Native Testing Library for frontend
- **Specific Requirements:**
  - Test file upload validation and security
  - Test database migration rollback scenarios
  - Test authentication integration with new endpoints
  - Test mobile camera/gallery integration
  - Test error handling for failed uploads
  - Test verification status workflow
