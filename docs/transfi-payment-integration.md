# Transfi Payment Integration Guide

## ✅ Integration Status: COMPLETE

The KeyLo app has been successfully migrated from Stripe to Transfi payment processing.

## 🔧 What Was Changed

### 1. Dependencies
- ❌ Removed: `@stripe/stripe-react-native` dependency
- ✅ Using: Transfi API via backend service

### 2. Frontend Changes
- **CheckoutScreen.tsx**: Updated payment button text and removed Stripe branding
- **PaymentScreen.tsx**: Already supported multiple payment methods via backend API
- **package.json**: Removed Stripe React Native dependency

### 3. Backend Integration
- **TransfiService**: Fully implemented service for Transfi API integration
- **Payment Endpoints**: 
  - `/api/payments/methods` - Returns available payment methods
  - `/api/payments/create-intent` - Creates Transfi payment intent
  - `/api/payments/webhook` - Handles Transfi webhook notifications

## 💳 Supported Payment Methods

Via Transfi, the app now supports:
1. **Credit/Debit Cards** - Instant processing
2. **Bank Transfers** - 1-2 business days
3. **Cryptocurrency** - USDC, USDT, BTC, ETH (10-30 minutes)

## 🔑 Environment Setup

The following environment variables need to be configured in `backend/.env`:

```env
TRANSFI_API_URL=https://api.transfi.com/v1
TRANSFI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
TRANSFI_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
TRANSFI_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here
```

## 🚀 Payment Flow

1. User completes booking details in `CheckoutScreen`
2. Booking is created in database
3. User is redirected to `PaymentScreen`
4. PaymentScreen fetches available methods from `/api/payments/methods`
5. User selects payment method
6. Frontend calls `/api/payments/create-intent` with booking ID
7. Transfi processes payment
8. Webhook confirms payment success/failure
9. User is redirected to confirmation screen

## 📊 Testing & Validation

- **Success**: 4111111111111111 (Visa)
- **Decline**: 4000000000000002 (Visa)
- **Insufficient Funds**: 4000000000009995

### Test Bank Account

### Test Crypto Addresses
- **USDC**: Available via Transfi test environment
- **ETH**: 0x742d35Cc6589C4532CE8b8b9db0B42F8b1f9E1Ab

## 🔧 Backend Implementation

### TransfiService Features
- ✅ Payment intent creation
- ✅ Webhook signature verification  
- ✅ Payment status tracking
- ✅ Multi-currency support
- ✅ Error handling & logging
- ✅ Secure API key management

### Database Integration
- Payment transactions are stored with Transfi payment ID
- Status updates are handled via webhooks
- Booking status is automatically updated on payment confirmation

## 🛡️ Security Features

1. **Webhook Verification**: All incoming webhooks are verified using Transfi signature
2. **API Key Security**: Keys are stored in environment variables, not in code
3. **Payment Validation**: All payments are verified before processing
4. **Idempotency**: Duplicate payments are prevented via unique transaction IDs

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Start the application**
2. **Create a booking** for any vehicle
3. **Proceed to payment** screen
4. **Select payment method** (card, bank, crypto)
5. **Complete payment** with test credentials
6. **Verify payment status** in database
7. **Check webhook logs** for proper processing

### API Testing

```bash
# Test payment methods endpoint
curl -X GET http://localhost:3003/api/payments/methods

# Test payment intent creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/payments/create-intent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"bookingId": "123", "amount": 100, "currency": "USD"}'

# Test webhook endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/payments/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Transfi-Signature: test_signature" \
  -d '{"event": "payment.succeeded", "paymentId": "txn_123"}'
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Payment method not available"**
   - Check Transfi API credentials
   - Verify account is properly configured
   - Ensure all required environment variables are set

2. **"Webhook signature invalid"**
   - Verify webhook secret matches Transfi dashboard
   - Check timestamp tolerance settings
   - Validate payload format

3. **"Payment declined"**
   - Use test card numbers for development
   - Check account limits and restrictions
   - Verify payment amount and currency

### Debug Logging

Enable debug mode in development:

```env
TRANSFI_DEBUG=true
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

This will provide detailed logs for all Transfi API interactions.

3. Updating environment variables
4. Database rollback for any Transfi-specific changes
