# Story 2.1: Intelligent Island-Based Search

## Status

**Current Status:** Completed

## Story

**As a** renter,  
**I want** the app to intelligently understand my location and show me the most relevant vehicles on my current island with smart filtering and recommendations,  
**so that** I can quickly find appropriate transportation without being overwhelmed by irrelevant options.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The app automatically detects or prompts for the user's current island location and defaults search results to that island.
2. Search includes intelligent filters for vehicle type, features, price range, and instant booking availability.
3. The search interface provides AI-powered vehicle recommendations based on trip purpose, duration, and user preferences.
4. Users can save searches and receive notifications when new matching vehicles become available.
5. The map view displays clustered vehicle locations with real-time availability indicators.

### Architecture Context

**Search Enhancement Architecture:**
- Extend existing SearchScreen in `IslandRidesApp/src/screens/SearchScreen.tsx`
- Create new intelligent search components in `IslandRidesApp/src/components/search/`
- Enhance existing vehicleService in `src/services/vehicleService.ts` with AI capabilities
- Build upon existing island detection in `src/screens/IslandSelectionScreen.tsx`

[Source: docs/architecture.md#3.4_Island_Filtering_Logic]

**Data Integration:**
- Extend existing searchVehicles method in vehicleService with intelligent parameters
- Integrate with existing island filtering logic using Firestore queries
- Build upon current vehicle recommendation system with AI enhancements
- Use existing vehicle data models and extend with search analytics

**Component Architecture:**
- Enhance existing filter components (DateFilter, PriceRangeFilter, etc.)
- Create new IntelligentFilterComponent following existing component patterns
- Extend MapView with clustering capabilities using existing map integration
- Build saved search components following existing UI component patterns

### Key Technical Considerations

**Previous Story Insights:**
- Story 1.5 established pro host analytics patterns that can inform recommendation algorithms
- Existing verification system provides trust signals for recommendation weighting
- Host dashboard analytics provide usage patterns that can improve search intelligence
- Real-time features from previous stories provide foundation for live availability updates

**Data Models:**
- Extend existing VehicleRecommendation interface with intelligence scores
- Add SearchPreferences model for user search behavior tracking
- Create SavedSearch model with notification preferences
- Enhance Island interface with search context and popularity metrics

**API Specifications:**
- Extend existing `/api/vehicles/search` endpoint with AI parameters
- Create new `/api/search/intelligence` endpoint for recommendation algorithms
- Add `/api/search/saved` endpoints for saved search management
- Implement `/api/search/notifications` for search alert management
- Enhance existing `/api/recommendations/${island}` with intelligent ranking

**Component Specifications:**
- IntelligentFilterComponent: Smart filter suggestions with context awareness
- SearchRecommendationCard: AI-powered vehicle recommendations with explanations
- SavedSearchManager: Persistent search management with notification controls
