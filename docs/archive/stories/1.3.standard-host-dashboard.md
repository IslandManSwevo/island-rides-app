## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Dashboard Structure:**
- Create new dashboard section in `IslandRidesApp/src/screens/Host/`
- Follow existing screen patterns and navigation structure
- Integrate with current authentication and user role management
- Use established component architecture from `src/components/`

**Data Integration:**
- Extend existing API services in `src/services/apiService.ts`
- Integrate with current vehicle and booking data models
- Use established state management patterns (Context API)
- Follow existing data caching strategies

**UI Components:**
- Build upon existing UI component library
- Follow established design system and styling patterns
- Use current navigation patterns from `src/navigation/`
- Maintain consistency with existing app styling

**Backend Integration:**
- Extend existing host-related endpoints in backend
- Use established authentication middleware
- Follow current database query patterns
- Integrate with existing booking and messaging systems

### Key Technical Considerations

**User Experience Design:**
- Focus on simplicity and ease of use for non-technical hosts
- Implement clear visual hierarchy and intuitive navigation
- Provide helpful tooltips and guidance for new hosts
- Design for quick task completion and minimal cognitive load

**Performance Optimization:**
