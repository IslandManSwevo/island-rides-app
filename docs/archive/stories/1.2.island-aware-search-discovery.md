# Story 1.2: Island-Aware Search & Discovery

## Status

**Current Status:** Completed

## Story

**As a** renter,  
**I want** to search for vehicles with island-based filtering and cross-island viewing capabilities,  
**so that** I can easily find vehicles on my current island or explore options on other islands.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The search interface includes an "Island Filter" that allows users to select specific islands or "All Islands".
2. Search results clearly indicate which island each vehicle is located on.
3. Users can toggle between "Current Island Only" and "All Islands" views.
4. The map integration shows vehicles with island-specific markers and boundaries.
5. Cross-island search results include estimated travel time/cost information when applicable.
6. The search maintains existing functionality while adding island-aware features.

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Search Service Integration:**
- Extend existing search functionality in `backend/services/searchService.js`
- Integrate with current vehicle database schema
- Maintain compatibility with existing search endpoints
- Use established search indexing patterns

**Frontend Search Components:**
- Build upon existing SearchScreen in `IslandRidesApp/src/screens/Search/`
- Extend current VehicleCard component in `src/components/`
- Integrate with existing map component in `src/components/Map/`
- Follow established state management patterns using Context API

**Map Integration:**
- Enhance existing map functionality (likely using react-native-maps)
- Integrate with current location services
- Build upon existing marker and clustering logic
- Maintain performance with increased map complexity

**Data Management:**
- Extend existing vehicle data structure to include island information
- Use established API patterns in `src/services/apiService.ts`
- Integrate with current caching strategies
- Follow existing data validation patterns

### Key Technical Considerations

**Island Data Structure:**
- Define standardized island identifiers and names
- Implement island boundary coordinates for map overlays
- Consider island hierarchy (main islands vs. smaller cays)
- Plan for future expansion to additional islands

**Search Performance:**
- Optimize database queries for island-based filtering
- Implement efficient indexing for island + other search criteria
- Consider caching strategies for island-specific searches
- Monitor search response times with additional filtering

**User Experience:**
- Provide clear visual distinction between island results
- Implement intuitive island selection interface
- Consider user's current location for default island selection
- Design for both local and tourist user scenarios

**Cross-Island Logistics:**
- Research and integrate basic ferry schedule data
- Implement realistic travel time calculations
- Consider seasonal variations in inter-island travel
- Plan for future integration with transportation booking

### Testing

**Testing Standards:**
- **Test File Location:** `backend/__tests__/search/` for backend tests, component tests in `src/components/__tests__/`
- **Test Standards:** Follow existing Jest and React Native Testing Library patterns
- **Testing Frameworks:** Jest for backend, React Native Testing Library for frontend, Detox for E2E
- **Specific Requirements:**
  - Test island filtering accuracy and performance
  - Test map integration with island boundaries
  - Test cross-island search result accuracy
  - Test search state management with island filters
  - Test backward compatibility with existing search
  - Test mobile performance with enhanced map features
  - Test location-based default island selection
