## **Section 5: Epic and Story Structure**

### **Epic Approach**

**Epic Structure Decision**: This entire enhancement will be managed as a single, comprehensive epic titled **"Host Management & Enhanced Discovery"**. This approach is chosen because the features are highly interconnected. For example, the Host Storefront is dependent on the verification features, and the Host Dashboard is dependent on the data generated by new bookings that come from the enhanced discovery features.

### **Epic 1: Host Management & Enhanced Discovery**

**Epic Goal**: To deliver a suite of professional tools for hosts that increases their engagement and trust, while simultaneously creating a superior, geographically-aware search experience for renters that drives platform growth.

#### **Story 1.1: Foundational Verification**

I want to implement the backend logic and UI for user and vehicle document uploads,  
so that we can establish a secure and compliant foundation for all host-related features.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. The database schema is updated with new migration files to support identity fields in the users table and legalDocs fields in the vehicles table.  
  2. The backend provides secure endpoints for uploading Driver's License, NIB Card, Vehicle Title, and Insurance documents.  
  3. The frontend includes a new "Verification" section in the user profile where users can upload their required documents.  
  4. The frontend includes a "Manage Documents" section in the vehicle management flow where hosts can upload titles and insurance for each vehicle.  
  5. The listingStatus of a vehicle cannot be set to "Active" until all required documents have been uploaded and an admin has approved them.

#### **Story 1.2: Island-Aware Search & Discovery**

As a renter,  
I want the app to automatically filter my search results based on my selected island,  
so that I only see relevant cars I can actually rent.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. The main search screen prominently features an "Island" selector, defaulting to a primary island (e.g., Grand Bahama).  
  2. Executing a search queries the backend with the selected island as a filter.  
  3. The search results map and list view only display vehicles where vehicle.island matches the selected island.  
  4. A clear toggle/button exists that allows the user to remove the island filter and view all vehicles.  
  5. The map view correctly displays vehicle pickup locations with custom-styled pins.

#### **Story 1.3: Standard Host Dashboard (Simple Mode)**

As a newly verified host,  
I want to access a simple dashboard,  
so that I can easily see my total earnings and manage my upcoming bookings.

  3. A "Verified Host" badge is prominently displayed.  
  4. The page displays a horizontally scrolling list of all "Active" vehicles owned by that host.  
  5. Tapping on a vehicle card navigates to that vehicle's detail page.  
  6. The host's overall rating and total number of completed trips are displayed.

#### **Story 1.5: Pro Host Dashboard (Pro Mode)**

As a host with multiple vehicles,  
I want to access advanced analytics,  
so that I can better understand my business performance and make strategic decisions.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. A "Pro" tab or section appears on the /dashboard for users who qualify (e.g., have more than one "Active" vehicle).  
  2. The Pro view includes a chart visualizing earnings over time (e.g., monthly).  
  3. The Pro view includes key performance metrics like booking rate, average trip duration, and top-performing vehicles.
